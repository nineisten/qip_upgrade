# QUBIC ICO PORTAL UPGRADE + PORTAL(QSWAP) INTEGRATION

## Introduction 
- Here we will outline the path forward for Both QIP and the integration with QSWAP and the PORTAL project. By creating and integrated experience, together we can offer builders the resources to help launch sustainable projects on the QUBIC eco-system. This means More Growth, less project abandonment, and increased trust among the entire QUBIC landscape. 

## Qubic Portal's Primary Driver for Integration

1. Increase LPs so we’d like an ICO page where LP is created immediately after ICO
(QX fees and LP creation fees paid out of ICO funds)
2. Dead projects dont do volume. Pump
And Dumps are temporary profit and ten dead. Or like Matilda where no funds for LP. So mechanics like staggered release of raised funds can keep projects around and build community.
3. As Qu price grows, minting on QX solely will become unaffordable.
4. Need to ensure a paid dev so project can keep being updated.

## Qubic ICO Portal's Primary Driver For Upgrade & Integration
1. Our Primary Driver from QIP:
2. Create a consistent stream of ICO launches
3. Help create a trusted Incubation environment which can Help launch more sustainable trusted projects within the QUBIC eco-system.
4. Upgrade QIP to include a Server api which can enable QIP to provide more detailed information on projects
5. creating a options that can enhance User Experience on both QIP and PORTAL platforms.
6. Creates multiple avenues for projects to launch on chain with minimal barriers to entry. (I.e, Bigger more defined projects use the QIP utility directly, while projects with limited experience or resources can launch with portal making the eco-system approachable by all levels of developers).
7. Onboard Official Team to maintain these platforms in perpetuity.
